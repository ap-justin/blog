this has something to do with aspect ratio

for the cropper, the aspect ratio is set to `4/1`, for the marketplace cards - it's `2/1`
and for the profile banners it's `2.76/1`

note that the profile banner aspect ratio `2.76/1` is not fixed and changes accordingly to layout. 
> PROFILE TWO-COLUMN VIEW, aspect is around `2.8/1`

> PROFILE SINGLE COLUMN VIEW, aspect is around `3/1`

NOTE: Having the aspect ratio `fixed` to certain value would make it aesthetic on certain layouts but look bad on other





## Two ways we set images

1. FILL, the image follows the aspect ratio of it's container
